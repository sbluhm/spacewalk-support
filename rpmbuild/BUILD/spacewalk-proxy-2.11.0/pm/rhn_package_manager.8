.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The Spacewalk Package Manager (\fBrhn_package_manager\fR) is the
custom channel management tool for the Spacewalk Proxy Server. 
.PP
A Spacewalk Proxy Server may manage \fBlocal/custom channels\fR\&. A
\fBchannel\fR is a logical grouping of packages that can be
installed using \fBrpm\fR\&. The Spacewalk Package Manager is used to populate
those custom channels with RPMs and SRPMs.
.PP
The Spacewalk Package Manager also provides the ability to create a local cache of RPMs that
does not expire and will be used instead of downloading the RPM when
applicable. This is useful even if the RPMs would be available otherwise
because it reduces the bandwidth required and can greatly speed up
RPM retrieval in the case of a slow network. This is accomplished with the
\fB--cache-locally\fR option in conjuction with a file list.
Normally the file list would come from the
\fB--from-export\fR or \fB--dir\fR options,
but the \fB--stdin\fR option or a file list specified on the
command line will also work. If for some reason you need to remove packages
from this cache in the future you will need to delete them from the
/var/spool/rhn-proxy/rhn directory. It is also possible to manually
populate this cache by copying the files / directories from
$base/redhat/*/ on a Spacewalk server into the above directory (where
$base is configurable, but by default is /var/satellite).
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-v, --verbose\fR
Increase verbosity
.TP
\fB-d \fIdirectory\fB,\fR
Process packages from this directory.
.TP
\fB-L, --cache-locally\fR
Only copy packages into the local cache; don't upload or
import the package metadata anywhere else. The only options
that can be used with \fB--cache-locally\fR
are \fB--test\fR,
\fB--from-export\fR,
\fB--dir\fR,
\fB--stdin\fR, and
\fB--channel\fR when used with
\fB--from-export\fR\&.
.TP
\fB-e \fIexport_location\fB,\fR
Process packages from the channel export. This can be either
a channel export that you have generated with
rhn-satellite-exporter or channel dump ISOs obtained
elsewhere (ISOs must be mounted, and the mount location given
here). If used with \fB--channel\fR this
will only process packages that are contained in that
channel, else all packages in the export will be processed.
If the channel export is spread across multiple ISOs it is
not required that you recombine them locally before running
\fBrhn_package_manager\fR, however you must
repeat the same command with each ISO to ensure that all
packages are found. Only functions in conjunction with the
\fB--cache-locally\fR or
\fB--copyonly\fR options.
.TP
\fB-c \fIchannel\fB,\fR
Operate on this channel -- may be present multiple times.
.TP
\fB-n \fIcount\fB,\fR
Process this number of headers per call -- the default is
32.
.TP
\fB-l, --list\fR
List the specified packages of the specified
channel(s).
.TP
\fB-s, --sync\fR
Check if in sync with the server.
.TP
\fB-p, --printconf\fR
Print the current configuration and exit.
.TP
\fB-X \fIpattern\fB,\fR
Exclude files matching this glob expression -- can be
present multiple times.
.TP
\fB--newest\fR
Only push the files that are newer than the server ones.
.TP
\fB--stdin\fR
Read the package names from stdin.
.TP
\fB--nosig\fR
Push unsigned packages. By default the Spacewalk Package Manager only attempts
to push signed packages.
.TP
\fB--username \fIusername\fB\fR
Use this username to connect to the Red Hat Satellite.
.TP
\fB--password \fIpassword\fB\fR
Use this password to connect to the Red Hat Satellite.
.TP
\fB--source\fR
Upload source package headers.
.TP
\fB--dontcopy\fR
Do not copy packages to the local directory.
.TP
\fB--copyonly\fR
An alias to \fB--cache-locally\fR for
backwards compatiblity.
.TP
\fB--test\fR
Only print the packages to be pushed.
.TP
\fB--no-ssl\fR
Turn off SSL (not recommended).
.TP
\fB-N, --new-cache\fR
create a new username/password cache
.TP
\fB--no-session-caching\fR
This option disabled session token authentication. Useful if you want to push to two or more different servers.
.TP
\fB-h, --help\fR
Display the help screen with a list of options.
.TP
\fB-?, --usage\fR
Briefly describe the options.
