=============================
 Community Repository Policy
=============================

The community repository has the following guideline for artifacts
published to it:

1. All published artifacts are the authors own work or have an
   appropriate license which grants distribution rights.

2. All published artifacts come from open source projects, that have an
   open patch acceptance policy.

3. All published artifacts are placed under an organization in a DNS
   domain for which you have the permission to use or are an owner
   (scala-sbt.org is available for sbt plugins).

4. All published artifacts are signed by a committer of the project
   (coming soon).
