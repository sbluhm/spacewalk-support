Nightly Builds
==============

The latest development versions of |version| are available as nightly builds on |typesafe-snapshots|_.

To use a nightly build, the instructions are the same for :doc:`normal manual setup </Getting-Started/Setup>` except:

1. Download the launcher jar from one of the subdirectories of |nightly-launcher|.
   They should be listed in chronological order, so the most recent one will be last.
2. The version number is the name of the subdirectory and is of the form
   `|version|.x-yyyyMMdd-HHmmss`. Use this in a `build.properties` file.
3. Call your script something like `sbt-nightly` to retain access to a
   stable `sbt` launcher.  The documentation will refer to the script as `sbt`, however.

Related to the third point, remember that an `sbt.version` setting in
`<build-base>/project/build.properties` determines the version of sbt
to use in a project. If it is not present, the default version
associated with the launcher is used. This means that you must set
`sbt.version=yyyyMMdd-HHmmss` in an existing
`<build-base>/project/build.properties`. You can verify the right
version of sbt is being used to build a project by running
`about`.

To reduce problems, it is recommended to not use a launcher jar for one
nightly version to launch a different nightly version of sbt.
