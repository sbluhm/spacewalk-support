.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBspacewalk-final-archive\fR archives as much exportable data as is available from a running spacewalk system
.PP
This tool leverages a number of existing spacewalk utilities, including \fBdb-control\fR, \fBspacewalk-report\fR, \fBspacewalk-debug\fR, and \fBspacewalk-export\fR, to collect their output into a specified location and gather it into one compressed file that can be easily stored elsewhere as an archive of the 'final' state of the spacewalk system.
.PP
Individual tools' output can be skipped if desired.
