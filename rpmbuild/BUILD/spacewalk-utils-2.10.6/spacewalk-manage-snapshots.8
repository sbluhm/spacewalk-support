.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBspacewalk-manage-snapshots\fR reports on and purges snapshots stored in the Red Hat Satellite or Spacewalk server instance on which the command is executed.
.PP
Snapshots are used to rollback system state when changes go awry. The snapshot-related tables grow with every change to a system; over time, they can grow quite large. This command is provided to give the Red Hat Satellite or Spacewalk server administrator a tool to cull old entries, since old snapshots are rarely of value.
.PP
When \fB--reports\fR is specified, the tool reports on the current size of all snapshot-related tables, as well as snapshot-age. Snapshots are grouped into 'buckets' based on an interval expressed as days. The default interval is 90 days; this can be overridden using the \fB--interval-older-than\fR switch.
.PP
When \fB--delete-older-than\fR is specified, the tool will arrange to delete all snapshots older than the specified number of days. The delete happens in batches; the default batch-size is 1000 snapshots. If a different batchsize is desired, this default can be overridden using the \fB--batch-size\fR switch.
.PP
There are three reasons the delete happens in batches. First, in the presence of hundreds of thousands or more snapshots to be deleted, the resulting cascading deletes can take tens of minutes to hours. Committing in batches means that even if the tool is interrupted for some reason, it will have made progress. Second, deleting large numbers of rows in one transaction can have painful implications for the size of undo/redo logs and general application performance. And third, since the delete-process impacts the snapshot-table, it can interfere with system registrations and deletes. Committing in batches provides opportunities for other processing involving snapshots to continue in parallel with the cleanup process.
.PP
When \fB--delete-older-than\fR is chosen, an entry is made to \fB/var/log/rhn/spacewalk-manage-snapshots.log\fR with the timestamp, executing-login, action, and results.
.PP
\fBspacewalk-manage-snapshots\fR is expected to be run as \fBroot\fR, on the Red Hat Satellite or Spacewalk server instance. It relies on the content of \fB/etc/rhn/rhn.conf\fR and direct access to the Red Hat Satellite or Spacewalk server database to accomplish its tasks.
