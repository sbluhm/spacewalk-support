 * needed for some task but the stream is not writing to anything

 * <p>
 * This acts similar to a <code>MonitoredOutputStream</code> in
 * that it notifies an <code>OutputMonitor</code>. However, this
 * will not wait for an I/O event before notification, once this 
 * has been created a <code>notifyFinished</code> is issued.
