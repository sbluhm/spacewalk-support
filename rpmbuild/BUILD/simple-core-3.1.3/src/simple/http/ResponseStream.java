/**
 * The <code>ResponseStream</code> is used to enable bytes written to
 * the response's <code>OutputStream</code> to be buffered. This also
 * enables the <code>Response.reset</code> method to be used.
 * <p>
 * Bytes written are buffered until the <code>flush</code> method is
 * invoked or until the buffer overflows. Once either of these events
 * occur the response is committed and the buffered bytes are written
 * to the response output stream. If a <code>flush</code> method is
 * explicitly invoked the response output stream is flushed, if the
 * buffer overflows the the buffer is written to the stream but not
 * flushed. This ensures that pipeline buffering is not affected.
 * <p>
 * This enables the connection to be configured so that Persistent
 * HTTP (PHTTP) connections can be maintained. RFC 2616 dictates that
 * all clients implementing the HTTP/1.1 protocol must support one of
 * three message delimiters, connection close, content length, and
 * chunked transfer encoding. The <code>ResponseStream</code> ensures
 * that if the client supports the chunked transfer encoding that the
 * chunked delimiter is used before a connection close.
