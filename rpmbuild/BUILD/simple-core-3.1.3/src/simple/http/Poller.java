/**
 * This is used to poll a pipeline for a HTTP request header. Once 
 * a request header is fully read from the <code>Pipeline</code>
 * then an HTTP transaction can take place. The objective of this
 * object is to read the HTTP request header in a non-blocking
 * manner so that multiple pipelines can be polled using a fixed
 * number of threads. This also serves to prioritize active pipes.
 * <p>
 * This is used in conjunction with the <code>PollerHandler</code> 
 * implementation which puts <code>Poller</code> objects on a wait 
 * queue and repeatedly dequeues the next poller object to execute
 * it. The <code>process</code> method performs a non-blocking 
 * read and either re-enqueues the poller if the HTTP header has 
 * not been fully read or dispatches the request for processing. 
 * <p>
 * The <code>Poller</code> implements the <code>ByteStore</code> 
 * interface which allows the bytes that were read from the header 
 * to be retrieved. The <code>ByteStore</code> is a read only so 
 * coupling is not a problem when the bytes are taken from it.
 * The performance of the <code>Poller</code> implementation is
 * fundamental to the performance of the entire system.
