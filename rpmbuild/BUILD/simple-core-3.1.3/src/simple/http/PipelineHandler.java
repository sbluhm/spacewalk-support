/**
 * The <code>PipelineHandler</code> interface is used to represent
 * an object that handles <code>Pipeline</code> objects in sequence
 * with a <code>ProtocolHandler</code>. This seperates the concrete
 * implementation class from the abstraction.
 * <p>
 * This <code>PipelineHandler</code> interface represents an object 
 * that is used to process <code>Pipeline</code> objects. The intended 
 * use of this is that it be used in conjunction with an implementation
 * of a <code>ProtocolHandler</code> implementation. The design is such 
 * that this will generate <code>Request</code> and <code>Response</code>
 * objects which will be passed to the <code>ProtocolHandler</code> for
 * processing.
 * <p>
 * The <code>PipelineHandler</code> implementation may employ a method
 * of handling the <code>Pipeline</code> in such a way that when the
 * <code>InputStream</code> does not produce any information for a 
 * certain length of time the connection is severed to recover file 
 * descriptors and other resources occupied by the possibly dead
 * connection.
