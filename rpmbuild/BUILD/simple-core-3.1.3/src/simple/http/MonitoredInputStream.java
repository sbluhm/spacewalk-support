 * The <code>InputMonitor</code> is used by a monitored stream to
 * handle any I/O events that occur while read data. Events such 
 * as <code>IOException</code>'s that are thrown are handled by 
 * invoking the monitor's <code>notifyError</code> method. This 
 * is synchronized so that it can be accessed by multiple threads.
