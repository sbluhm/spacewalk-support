/**
 * This is a <code>Monitor</code> object that is used to reprocess 
 * a <code>Poller</code>. When a request has been taken from a the
 * <code>Pipeline</code> being polled, and a reponse has been issued,
 * then this means that that <code>Pipeline</code> is no longer being
 * used, and so the <code>Pipeline</code> is ready to be used in the 
 * next request. 
 * <p>
 * If however there was an error in processing the current request 
 * then this <code>Monitor</code> will be notified. In the case that 
 * there was an error in processing a request/response transaction 
 * using this <code>Poller</code> then the <code>Poller</code> will 
 * not be reprocessed. The <code>Poller</code> is only reprocessed 
 * when the transaction is finished, indicated by a 
 * <code>notifyFinished</code> for both the <code>OutputStream</code> 
 * and the <code>InputStream</code> of the <code>Pipeline</code>. 
 * <p>
 * Also if there was a <code>notifyClose</code> event then the 
 * <code>Poller</code> will be closed by calling the <code>close</code> 
 * method. In this case the <code>Poller</code> will not be reprocessed. 
 * <p>
 * In summary this is used to indicate when the next HTTP message 
 * header is the next group of bytes on the <code>Pipeline</code> 
 * and the <code>Pipeline</code>'s output for the previous request 
 * has been made.
