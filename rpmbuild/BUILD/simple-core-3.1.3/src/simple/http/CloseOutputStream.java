 * bytes written to the stream, it is used only to provide a close
 * of the underlying stream when <code>close</code> is used.
 * <p>
 * This requirement for a stream that performs a simple close can
 * be found in RFC 2616 section 4.4, Message Length. This allows a
 * client to recognize the length of the content when the stream 
 * the content is delivered on is explicitly closed.
