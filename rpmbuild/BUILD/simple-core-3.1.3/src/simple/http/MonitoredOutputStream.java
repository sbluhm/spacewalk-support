 * monitoring of data written to an underlying stream. This must be
 * subclassed so that behavior can be added to the writing of data
 * and so that the stream can perform a dialog with the monitor.
 * <p>
 * The <code>OutputMonitor</code> is used by a monitored stream to
 * handle any I/O events that occur while writing data. Events 
 * such as <code>IOException</code>'s that are thrown are handled
 * by invoking the monitor's <code>notifyError</code> method. This
 * is synchronized so that it can be accessed by multiple threads.
