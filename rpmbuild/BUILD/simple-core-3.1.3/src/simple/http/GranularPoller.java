/**
 * The <code>GranularPoller</code> object is implemented to wait
 * between failed polls using a gradually increasing wait time.
 * This polling strategy ensures that the server can respond to
 * pipelines quickly when they become active after a peroid of
 * inactivity. This also enables the pipeline to say open longer.
 * <p>
 * The wait phase is calculated by the <code>BasicPoller</code>
 * and indicates the number of polls that have resulted in zero
 * bytes being read from the pipeline. This simply uses the phase
 * as an index into a array of pre-calculated wait times.
 * <p>
 * This type of poller is recommended for browsers that cannot
 * handle cuircumstances where an asynchronous close may occur.
 * For example when the browser requires some user input before 
 * it sends the new request, like accepting an SSL certificate.
 * For further information of asynchronous closure see RFC 2616
 * section 8.1.4 on practical considerations.
