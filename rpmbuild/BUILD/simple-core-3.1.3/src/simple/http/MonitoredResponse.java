 * transaction.

 * This <code>Response</code> will send any critical events to an 
 * <code>OutputMonitor</code> for processing, this may have the 
 * effect of closing the <code>OutputStream</code> used by the 
 * <code>Response</code>.

 * This provides features which allow the message body to be blocked
 * if it should not be sent with the headers as of RFC 2616 rules for 
 * the presence of a message body. A message body must not be 
 * included with a HEAD request or with a 304 or a 204 response.
