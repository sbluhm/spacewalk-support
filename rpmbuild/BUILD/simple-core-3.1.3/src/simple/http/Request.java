/**
 * This interface is used to represent a HTTP request. This defines 
 * the attributes that a HTTP request has such as a request line and 
 * the headers that come with the message header. 
 * <p>
 * The <code>Request</code> is used to provide an interface to the 
 * HTTP <code>InputStream</code> and message header. The stream can
 * have certain characteristics, these characteristics are available 
 * by this object. The <code>Request</code> provides methods that 
 * allow the <code>InputStream</code>'s semantics to be known, for 
 * example if the stream is keep-alive or if the stream has a length.
 * <p>
 * The <code>Request</code> origin is also retrievable from the
 * <code>Request</code> as is the <code>Attributes</code> object
 * which defines specific connection attributes.
 * <p>
 * It is important to note that the <code>Request</code> controls
 * the processing of the HTTP pipeline. The next HTTP request is 
 * not processed until the request has read all of the content body
 * within the <code>InputStream</code>. The stream must be fully
 * read or closed for the next request to be processed.
