/** 
 * The <code>FilterResponse</code> object is used so that the original
 * <code>Response</code> object can be wrapped in a filtering proxy
 * object. This allows a <code>ProtocolHandler</code> to interact with
 * the <code>Response</code> object in a concurrent environment. This 
 * is also useful if any special behavior is need when a HTTP header 
 * with special significance is added.
 * <code><pre>
 *
 *    public void handle(Request req, Response resp) {
 *       handler.handle(req, new ZipResponse(resp));
 *    }
 *
 * </pre></code>
 * The above is an example of how the <code>FilterResponse</code> can 
 * be used to provide extra functionality to a <code>Response</code>
 * in a transparent manner. Such an implementation could apply a
 * Content-Encoding header and compress the response for performance
 * over a slow network. Filtering can be applied with the use of
 * layered <code>ProtocolHandler</code> objects, an example of such
 * layering is the <code>simple.http.serve.DomainHandler</code>.
