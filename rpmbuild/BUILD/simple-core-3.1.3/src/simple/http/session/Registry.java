/**
 * The <code>Registry</code> object is used to acquire and store
 * the <code>Module</code> objects used by the session management
 * system. This acts much like a factory in that it will create
 * a module if it does not exist. Once the module is created it
 * is registered as the name provided by the <code>Cookie</code>.
 * <p>
 * All modules have leased registration within this registry.
 * This means that once the lease expires the module is removed
 * from the system. So in order to maintain the module within
 * the registry the <code>Lease</code> associated with it must
 * be renewed peroidically.
