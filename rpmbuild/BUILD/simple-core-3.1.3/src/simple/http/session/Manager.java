/**
 * The <code>Manager</code> object provides the interface to the
 * session management system. This enables <code>Session</code>
 * objects to be created and retrieved from the system. Sessions
 * are created if the issued <code>State</code> does not have
 * a session reference cookie or if it contains a reference to a
 * dead session. If a reference to a dead session is found a new
 * one is created and is referred to with the existing cookie.
 * <p>
 * If the <code>Manager</code> creates a new session then it
 * invokes the <code>Store.prepare</code> method for a new 
 * instance. This method is given the argument provided in the
 * <code>getSession</code> method, which is either null if none
 * is provided or an object of the users choice. This allows the
 * <code>Store</code> the possibility of setting up JDBC 
 * connections by possibly passing it a URI to connection to
 * the database, for example "jdbc:mysql://host/database" could
 * be used to setup the connection to the remote database.
