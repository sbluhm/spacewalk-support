/**
 * The <code>Session</code> object is used to store session data
 * relating to a specific HTTP client. The HTTP protocol does not
 * maintain state between requests, so in order to build up data
 * some identifier from the HTTP request must be used to acquire
 * session information. Typically the session identifier is taken
 * from a HTTP cookie, which can then be used to acquire data.
 * That data is stored in a <code>Session</code> implementation.
 * <p>
 * This interface hides the complexities of the session handling
 * system, which is broken into two separate entities. The first
 * is the <code>Store</code> which acts as the storage mechanism
 * for session variables, the other is the leasing mechanism,
 * which is used to determine when a session has expired. The
 * result is a very simple session management mechanism.
