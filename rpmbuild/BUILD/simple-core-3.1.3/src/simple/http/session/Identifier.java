 * The <code>Identifier</code> is responsible for extracting and
 * creating the session identifier from the collection of cookies
 * sent with the HTTP request. The <code>State</code> object
 * contains all cookies sent with the HTTP request including the
 * session identity. So the task of identifying the session to
 * the session management system is a matter of locating the
 * cookie that contains the session identifier.
 * <p>
 * If the <code>State</code> does not contain a reference to a
 * session then this must create a new reference. This reference
 * must be a <code>simple.util.net.Cookie</code> object and must
 * be inserted into the <code>State</code> so that it will be
 * recieved by the client. The session management system will
 * then use that cookie value to reference the new session.
