/**
 * The <code>ReflectionStore</code> enables initialization to 
 * be achieved using arbitrary <code>prepare</code> methods. 
 * This will attempt to discover the <code>prepare</code> method 
 * implemented by the subclass before invoking it. The discovery 
 * is done using Java reflection to match the arguments to the 
 * <code>prepare</code> method. For example take
 * the <code>prepare</code> signatures illustrated below.
 * <pre>
 *
 *    public void prepare(Map) throws Exception
 *    public void prepare(List, String) throws Exception
 *
 * </pre>
 * The above methods will be discovered by checking the class of
 * the <code>Object</code> parameter that is issued to the
 * <code>ReflectionStore.prepare(Object)</code> method. The 
 * class of the object is determined using <code>getClass</code>.
 * If the parameter to the subclasses <code>prepare</code> is the
 * same class, a superinterface, or a superclass of that class 
 * then it will be invoked to initialize that instance.
 * <p>
 * This treats only a type of <code>Object[]</code> as a special
 * case. If the object parameter is an array of objects then
 * the discovery of the initialization method is performed by
 * matching the method with the class type of each of the
 * individual <code>Object.getClass</code> classes extracted
 * from the array. So if both prepare methods illustrated above
 * were implemented by a single subclass, then to invoke the
 * <code>prepare(List, String)</code> method, use the follwing.
 * <pre>
 *
 *    Object data = new Object[]{new Vector(), "text"};
 *
 * </pre>
 * This allows the <code>Store</code> implementation to have
 * several <code>prepare</code> methods and, depending on the 
 * type of the issued parameter, have the appropriate method to
 * be invoked when it is loaded by the <code>Manager</code>.
