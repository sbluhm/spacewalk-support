 * The <code>Store</code> object provides the persistence scheme
 * used by sessions. In order to facilitate a range of storage
 * techniques for session data the <code>Session</code> must be
 * able to avail of arbitrary strategies. An implementation of
 * this interface can be used to store all objects given to
 * a session instance. For example, objects can be stored within
 * a relational database, a file, or some in-memory container.
 * <p>
 * To configure the system to use a specific implementation the
 * system property <code>simple.http.session.store</code> can be
 * used. If this is not specified then a default implementation
 * is used which simply stores the data within an internal map.
 * All <code>Store</code> implementations must have a single
 * argument constructor that takes a <code>Cookie</code>.
