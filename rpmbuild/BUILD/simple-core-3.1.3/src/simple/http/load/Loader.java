/**
 * The <code>Loader</code> object represents an object that uses 
 * the <code>LoaderManager</code> to load and link resources. The
 * loader will recieve updates regarding changes with the manager.
 * This is done so the implementation can take action based on the
 * most up to date information. The implementation can also make
 * make changes to links using the <code>LoaderManager</code> or
 * (un)load resources. This is useful if there is an administration 
 * application that is used to manage resource configurations with 
 * the <code>LoaderManager</code>. 
 * <p>
 * The intended use of the <code>Loader</code> is that it be used
 * with some sort of graphical administration utility. The update
 * messages can then be used to refresh or repaint the graphics
 * which provides the user with a consistent view of the remote
 * <code>LoaderManager</code> configuration.
