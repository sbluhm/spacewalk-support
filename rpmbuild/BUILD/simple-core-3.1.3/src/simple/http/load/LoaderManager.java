/**
 * The <code>LoaderManager</code> is used to load <code>Service</code>
 * implementation classes. This can be used from a remote network host
 * using RMI as it extends the <code>Remote</code> interface. Each
 * <code>Service</code> that is loaded can be purged from the system
 * using the <code>unload</code> method.
 * <p>
 * Once an object has been loaded into the system it needs to be looked
 * up in terms of a URI path. This enables links between the service
 * name and a wildcard pattern to be made. When the pattern is matched 
 * by a URI the resource can be isolated. A service instance can be 
 * linked to several patterns. If the service is to be unlinked the 
 * <code>unlink</code> method can remove the pattern from the system.
 * <p>
 * Configuring the links made with the <code>LoaderManager</code> can
 * be done using the <code>Loader</code>. This will ensure that the
 * changes in the configuration of links with the manager will be 
 * transmitted to the <code>Loader</code>. This can thus be used as 
 * a means to provide graphical administration of the manager.
