/**
 * The <code>DefaultPoller</code> object is implemented to wait
 * between failed polls using an exponentially increasing wait
 * duration. This ensures that the more inactive the pipeline the 
 * less time the system spends polling that pipeline. Determining
 * the length of time to wait is done using the wait given phase.
 * <p>
 * The wait phase is calculated by the <code>BasicPoller</code>
 * and indicates the number of polls that have resulted in zero
 * bytes being read from the pipeline. This simply uses the phase
 * as an index into a array of pre-calculated wait times.
