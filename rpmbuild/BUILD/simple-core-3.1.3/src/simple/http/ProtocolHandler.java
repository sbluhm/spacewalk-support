 * This is a <code>ProtocolHandler</code> that is used to process
 * HTTP <code>Request</code> and <code>Response</code> objects. The
 * intended purpose of the <code>ProtocolHandler</code> object is
 * to process <code>Request</code> and <code>Response</code> objects,
 * that is, respond to the given <code>Request</code>.
 * <p>
 * Any implementation should make this method thread safe as the
 * <code>Request</code> and <code>Response</code> objects will be
 * passed in concurrently with perhaps many other instances.
 * <p>
 * The <code>ProtocolHandler</code> is entirely responsible for the
 * HTTP message headers and body. It is up to the implementation to
 * ensure that it complies to RFC 2616 or any previous specification.
 * All headers and the status line can be modified by this object.
