/**
 * The <code>StateCookie</code> is used to provide a means for a
 * callback to be made to the source <code>State</code> when a
 * property has changed in the cookie. This is used to reduce the
 * effort required to make quick changes to existing cookies. So
 * rather than having to acquire the instance, make the change,
 * and finally set the cookie, this allows the cookie to be set
 * in such a way that the <code>State</code> is automatically
 * updated. This means changes in any cookie sent with the request
 * will be sent as a Set-Cookie header with the response.
