/**
 * The <code>Locator</code> interface is used to locate resources
 * outside the scope of a <code>Context</code>. This is required 
 * so that various configuration files and other resources can be
 * located by the system. Resources such as XML files and Java
 * properties files required to configure various objects can be
 * discovered using an implementation of this interface.
 * <p> 
 * This provides a set of methods similar to the methods provided
 * by the <code>Context</code> object. However unlike that object
 * resources are located with more flexibility as it does not have 
 * restricted scope. Also, this does not accept a URI target name 
 * to locate the files, instead this will typically be given the 
 * name of a resource. For example if an XML configuration file 
 * named <code>config.xml</code> was to be located then it could
 * be located using an alias like <code>config</code> or possibly
 * with the file name itself, without any path information.
 * <p>
 * For simplicity and portability an implementation of this should
 * be able to cope with path information in the event that it is
 * supplied. Paths in URI format like <code>/bin/config.xml</code>
 * and also system dependant format (although not advisable) like 
 * <code>.\bin\config.xml</code> for a Windows system should be
 * acceptable to an implementation.
