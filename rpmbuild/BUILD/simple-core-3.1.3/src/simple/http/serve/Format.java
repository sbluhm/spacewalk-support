/**
 * The <code>Format</code> class is used to provide a specified format to 
 * pages retrived by the <code>ResourceEngine</code>. Every instance of 
 * the <code>ResourceEngine</code> operates using a <code>Context</code>
 * object. The <code>Context</code> object provides a view of the 
 * underlying file system. Each <code>Context</code> contains a
 * <code>Format</code> object. This is used to generate HTML messages
 * for the specific resource.
 * <p>
 * The <code>Format</code> object is responsible for generating pages 
 * for specific resources and error messages. So when a web browser
 * contacts the web server that is using a <code>ResourceEngine</code> 
 * the resource engine can defer to the <code>Format</code> object. 
 * <pre>
 *    format.getContents(context, "/example/");
 * </pre>
 * This method invocation will allow the <code>Format</code> object to
 * create a directory listing for the target "/example/" relative
 * to the context path which for example on DOS could be "c:\winnt".
