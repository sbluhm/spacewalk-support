/**
 * The <code>ContentFactory</code> is used to create instances of 
 * the <code>Content</code> object. This is used in conjunction
 * with the <code>FactoryContext</code> to create content objects
 * from issued request URI strings. Because the instances are 
 * created by the <code>FactoryContext</code> a lifecycle must be
 * obeyed by the produced implementations. This lifecycle states
 * that the instance is loaded and used for a limited time.
 * <p>
 * This is required to return a <code>Content</code> instance if
 * there is a suitable match for the issued request URI. If the
 * issued request URI cannot be resolved <code>getInstance</code>
 * must throw a <code>ContentException</code>. The request URI
 * issued to the <code>getInstance</code> is the same as the URI
 * issued to any of the <code>Context</code> methods.
