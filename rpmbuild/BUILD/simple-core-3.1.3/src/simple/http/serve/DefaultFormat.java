 * The <code>DefaultFormat</code> object is used to provide pages
 * for the <code>FileEngine</code> that are consistant and have
 * a user specified format. This is used as the default system 
 * format when there is no explicit specification of a default
 * using the system property "simple.http.serve.format". If
 * this property is specified a class loader will attempt to 
 * load and instantiate a format of the specified type.
 * <p>
 * The <code>Format</code> of the <code>FileEngine</code> can
 * be changed from the <code>DefaultFormat</code> by simply 
 * giving the VM the class name of the desired format like
 *
 * <pre>
 * java -Dsimple.http.serve.format=demo.example.FancyFormat
 * </pre>
 *
 * The <code>FormatFactory</code> produces the system default
 * <code>Format</code> implementaion. This is used with the
 * <code>FileEngine.getInstance</code> when the context object
 * is not explicitly used. This implementation only supports 
 * the contents of directory resources. If the resource is
 * requested is not a directorys a <code>FormatException</code>
 * is thrown.

    * Often times a web browser will request a directory resource not
    * knowing that it is a directory. This causes a problem when the
    * page that is generated contains HTTP hyperlinks to each resource
    * in that directory, much like Apache does. The problem arises 
    * when the user clicks on the resource hyperlink. Since the client
    * browser thinks it requested a HTML file it simply requests that
    * resource with the same directory root. For example say the client
    * requests the resource http://some.host/usr/bin. The web server
    * using a <code>FileEngine</code> object will aquire a listing for
    * the directory /usr/bin. All references to files in this HTML list
    * must be given the prefix bin/. So that when the browser clicks on 
    * a file, say index.html, its get http://some.host/usr/bin/index.html 
    * and not http://some.host/usr/index.html.
