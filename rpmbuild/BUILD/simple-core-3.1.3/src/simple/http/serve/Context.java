/**
 * The <code>Context</code> interface is used to give a view of the
 * file system to the <code>ResourceEngine</code>. This provides the 
 * information to the <code>ResourceEngine</code> that it needs in 
 * order to serve content to the client browser. This provides the 
 * path translations for the HTTP request URI. This also provides 
 * the <code>Format</code> object that is used to create directory 
 * listings and error messages.
 * <p>
 * This object essentially provides a mechanism that allows the file
 * engine to convert the HTTP request URI into OS system paths and
 * system objects such as the <code>File</code> object. A context
 * is rooted a a certain directory in the system. This directory is
 * where the resources are gathered from. For example suppose that
 * a <code>Context</code> implementation is rooted at the directory
 * "c:\web\html\" on a DOS system. Now if the target of the browser 
 * was "http://some.host/web/pub/README". The context needs to be
 * consulted to convert "/web/pub/README" into the real path within
 * the system. So <code>Context.getRealPath</code> is invoked with
 * the path "/web/pub/README", which responds with the system path
 * "c:\web\html\web\pub\README". Also if this was a UNIX system 
 * with the same context rooted at "/home/user/html" then the same
 * URL would result in "/home/user/html/web/pub/README".
 * <p>
 * The meaning of HTTP URI in this instance is the request URI
 * from a HTTP/x.x request, as RFC 2616 and RFC 2396 defines it
 *
 * <pre> 
 * Request-Line = Method SP Request-URI SP HTTP-Version CRLF
 *
 * Request-URI = "*" | absoluteURI | abs_path | authority
 * absoluteURI = "http:" "//" host [":" port] [abs_path ["?" query]] 
 * abs_path = "/" path_segments         
 * path_segments = segment *( "/" segment )
 * </pre> 
 *
 * So the <code>Context</code> object must be prepared to accept 
 * the request URI that come in the form outlined above. These can
 * include formats like 
 *
 * <pre> 
 * http://some.host/pub;param=value/bin/index.html?name=value
 * http://some.host:8080/index.en_US.html
 * some.host:8080/index.html
 * /usr/bin;param=value/README.txt
 * /usr/bin/compress.tar.gz
 * </pre>
 *
 * The <code>Context</code> implementation should be able to 
 * directly take a Request-URI as defined in RFC 2616 and translate 
 * this into a path compatible with the OS specific file system. 
 * This keeps the objects semantics simple and explicit, although 
 * at the expense of performance.
