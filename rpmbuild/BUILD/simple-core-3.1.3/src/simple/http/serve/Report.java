/**
 * The <code>Report</code> interface is used to describe a HTTP
 * response message. Reporting the various HTTP error and status
 * messages requires that a status code and textual description
 * be provided in the response, also depending on the type of
 * response a description of the cause can be provided in the
 * HTTP message body. 
 * <p>
 * The <code>getCode</code> method must return a valid HTTP 
 * status code so that it can be used to describe the response,
 * also the <code>getText</code> method must supply a short
 * description of the response. For example, a description for
 * the 404 HTTP status code would be 'File Not Found', for more
 * information of valid descriptions see RFC 2616 section 6.1.1.
