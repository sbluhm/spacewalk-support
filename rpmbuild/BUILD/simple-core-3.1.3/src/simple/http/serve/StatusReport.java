 * The <code>StatusReport</code> is used to describe HTTP status

 * provided. This will pair a provided status code with a short 
 * description of the status that HTTP status code represents as
 * outlined by RFC 2612 section 6.1.1. 
 * <p>
 * The <code>getCause</code> method will provide an empty
 * description of the cause, as changes in status are typically
 * driven by the service implementations and therefore are not
 * directly caused by any specific event.
