/**
 * The <code>FileLocator</code> provides an implementation of the
 * <code>Locator</code> interface for locating files from a list of
 * directories. This will use the list of directories to search for
 * named files. The list of files is searched by increasing index so
 * the first occurrence of a named file found in the search path will
 * be used. This accepts the name of the file to be used, so for 
 * example if the file required was <code>example.xml</code> then
 * the name alone should be supplied. If however path information 
 * is supplied it can be in a URI or platform specific format.
