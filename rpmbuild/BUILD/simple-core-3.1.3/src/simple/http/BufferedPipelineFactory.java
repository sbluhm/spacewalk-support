 * so that the TCP packets that are sent using the sockets output 
 * stream have a size that is sufficently large. The motive for using 
 * output buffering for the TCP packets can be found in Performance 
 * Interacrions Between P-HTTP and TCP-implementations 1997.

 * The implementation is by default created as a factory object for
 * creating <code>BufferedPipeline</code> instances. This is done so
 * that it can be used to dynamically issue buffered pipelines using
 * the <code>ConnectionHandlerFactory</code> object.
