/**
 * The <code>FixedInputStream</code> class is used to read a specified 
 * number of bytes from a given <code>InputStream</code>. This is a 
 * <code>MonitoredInputStream</code> class. 
 * <p>
 * This is used to monitor and read input from a given stream. This
 * sends event notification to a monitor. Events such as the the reading
 * of the number of bytes specified is a <code>notifyFinished</code>
 * event. When there is an error the error is propagated and the monitor
 * is also notified of the event. 
 * <p>
 * If a close is invoked before the number of bytes specified has been 
 * read then this attempts to read and discard the unread bytes without 
 * blocking. However this cannot be done then a <code>notifyError</code> 
 * event is preferred to a <code>notifyFinished</code> event, this will 
 * cause the monitor to close the stream.
