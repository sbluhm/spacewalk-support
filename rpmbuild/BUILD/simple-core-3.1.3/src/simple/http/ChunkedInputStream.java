/**
 * The <code>ChunkedInputStream</code> is reads an decodes a stream
 * using the chunked transfer coding. This is used so that any data
 * sent in the chunked transfer coding can be decoded, and event
 * notification can be sent to an <code>OutputMonitor</code>. For
 * details on notification see <code>MonitoredInputStream</code>.
 * <pre>
 *
 *    length := 0
 *    read chunk-size, chunk-extension (if any) and CRLF
 *    while (chunk-size &gt; 0) {
 *       read chunk-data and CRLF
 *       append chunk-data to entity-body
 *       length := length + chunk-size
 *       read chunk-size and CRLF

 *
 * </pre>
 * The above algorithm is taken from RFC 2616 section 19.4.6. This
 * coding scheme is used in HTTP pipelines so that dynamic content,
 * that is, content with which a length cannot be determined does
 * not require a connection close to delimit the message body.
