/**
 * The <code>ChunkedOutputStream</code> is used to write data in the
 * chunked transfer encoding to an underlying <code>OutputStream</code>.
 * This is a <code>MonitoredOutputStream</code> and so notifies an
 * <code>OutputMonitor</code> of any events regarding the writing of
 * the data. The chunked encoding procedure can be found in RFC 2616.
 * <pre>
 *
 *    chunked-body   = *chunk last-chunk trailer CRLF
 *    chunk          = chunk-size [ chunk-extension ] CRLF
 *                     chunk-data CRLF
 *    chunk-size     = 1*HEX
 *    last-chunk     = 1*("0") [ chunk-extension ] CRLF
 *
 *    chunk-extension= *( ";" chunk-ext-name [ "=" chunk-ext-val ] )
 *    chunk-ext-name = token
 *    chunk-ext-val  = token | quoted-string
 *    chunk-data     = chunk-size(OCTET)
 *    trailer        = *(entity-header CRLF) 
 *
 * </pre>
 * The above BNF description of the chunked transfer encoding is from
 * RFC 2616, section 3.6.1. This encoding is self delimiting, so as
 * a <code>MonitoredOutputStream</code> this is only required to give
 * notification of <code>notifyFinished</code> when the stream is 
 * closed and <code>notifyError</code> if there is a problem writing.
