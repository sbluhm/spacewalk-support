/**
 * The <code>PlainState</code> is a default implementation of the
 * <code>State</code> interface used by the <code>Request</code> to
 * examine the cookies that have been issued with the HTTP request.
 * The purpose of this interface is to provide implementations of
 * the <code>ProtocolHandler</code> with a simple HTTP state control
 * mechanism. This provides access to the cookies issued using the
 * <code>simple.http.net.Cookie</code> object.
 * <p>
 * The HTTP State Management Mechanism, RFC 2109, specifies Cookie
 * and Set-Cookie headers that can be used by HTTP servers to manage
 * state across multiple requests. The <code>State</code> object
 * abstracts this by setting up a context between the
 * <code>Request</code> and <code>Response</code>. The various
 * <code>setCookie</code> methods enable the <code>State</code>
 * to be used to add Set-Cookie headers to the HTTP response header
 * once it commits and cookie objects can be examined using the
 * <code>getCookie</code> and <code>getValue</code> methods.
