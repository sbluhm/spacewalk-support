 * This will block a thread from dequeuing when there is not items 
 * in the queue. It will also block an enqueuer if there is no space 
 * left in the queue.

 * When a thread is waiting and gets notified by another thread the 
 * thread that has been notified reasserts the check for the full

    * enqueuer can notify a dequeuer as well as only a dequeuer can
    * notify a enqueuer. This does an iterative check because of the
    * semantics of the wait/notify paradigm. When a dequeuer is
    * waiting to be notified it will add 1 to the dequeuers count. When

    * the only enqueued item. Once the notified thread regains the lock
    * it will have to detect wheather another thread dequeued the only
    * object, if this is the case the thread must wait again to be
