/**
 * This is used by the <code>Scheduler</code> to manage the threads
 * that are dequeuing from the <code>Scheduler</code>. This allows
 * threads to be added to an dequeuers list. When a thread is waiting
 * to dequeue an object from the <code>Scheduler</code> it registers
 * itself with the <code>Registry</code> by calling the sleeping
 * method and specifing when the object will wake.
 * <p>
 * This <code>Registry</code> allows threads to be interrupted from a
 * sleeping state. When a thread is waiting on an objects timeout to
 * expire it may be interrupted. The interrupt method is there to allow
 * an enqueuer to say that there is a new object being enqueued which
 * has a timeout that may be less than one of the sleeping threads. If
 * this is the case then the thread will be interrupted. This ensures
 * that an object will allways exit at its timeout and wont be blocked
 * sleeping for another object with a higher timeout.
