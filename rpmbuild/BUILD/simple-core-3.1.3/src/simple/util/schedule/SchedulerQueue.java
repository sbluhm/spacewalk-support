 * This is a <code>SchedulerQueue</code> used to prioritize objects
 * enqueued. This queue is a <code>PriorityQueue</code>. It ensures
 * the object with the highest priority value will leave the queue
 * first, this also ensures that a null item is never dequeued.
 * <p>
 * This prioritizes the entry into a <code>PriorityQueue</code> so
 * that objects that are removed can be synchronized if there are
 * multiple threads removing from the queue. It is important to
 * note that this should not cap the prioritys be cause the queue
 * that is being used will only remove objects that are highest
 * in priority at the moment of <code>PriorityQueue.dequeue</code>
 * so if the prioritys are all capped then it becomes impossible
 * to remove some of the items from the queue.
