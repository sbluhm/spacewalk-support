/**
 * The <code>PulseScheduler</code> is a scheduler that is used when
 * the time accuracy is not of great importance. This will ensure that
 * the scheduled items can be dequeued in pulses. 
 * <p>
 * The aim of this type of <code>Scheduler</code> is to allow a large 
 * number of items to be enqueued using a large number of threads. 
 * The fact that there is a large number of threads means that the 
 * <code>Registry</code> will issue a large number of interrupts to 
 * dequeuers. The aim of the <code>PulseScheduler</code> is to ensure 
 * that the number of thread interrupts issued is kept low. 
 * <p>
 * It achives this by ensuring that threads that are enqueuing objects
 * have timeouts that are rounded to the nearest pulse. The effect that
 * this has is that many objects will be enqueued with the same timeout 
 * values. When an enqueue is invoked the <code>Registry</code> is looked 
 * up to see if there is a thread dequeuing that has a larger timeout, if 
 * the timeouts are rounded then the <code>Registry</code> will see that
 * there are few threads that are dequeuing with larger timeout values an
 * interrupt will not be issued. 
 * <p>
 * Care should be taken when choosing this type of <code>Scheduler</code>,
 * large performance decreases can be incurred if the problem does not fit 
 * with the <code>PulseScheduler</code>. For most problems the default
 * <code>Scheduler</code> is a better choice. This has a default maximum 
 * timeout of one minute and a default pulse of one hundred ms.
