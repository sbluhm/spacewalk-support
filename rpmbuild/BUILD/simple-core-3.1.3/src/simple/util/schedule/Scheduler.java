/**
 * The <code>Scheduler</code> is used for scheduling arbitrary objects.
 * When arbitrary objects are enqueued into a <code>Scheduler</code>
 * the <code>Scheduler</code> object will guarantee that that object
 * will not be dequeued until its timeout has expired.
 * <p>
 * This guarantees that an object is returned when the dequeue method
 * is invoked. If there are no objects within the <code>Scheduler</code>
 * then the thread that invoked this dequeue method will wait until there
 * is an object to dequeue. If however there is an object within the
 * <code>Scheduler</code> the dequeue method will block the thread
 * until such time as the objects timeout has expired or if another
 * object has been enqueued concurrently that will allow the dequeue
 * method to return earlier then it returns the object which has the
 * least time to wait.
 * <p>
 * The waiting of an object is based on the time when it is allowed to
 * be released. For instance if an object with a given timeout of 1000
 * ms is enqueued then the time when that object is permitted to be
 * released is the sum of the <code>System.currentTimeMillis</code> and
 * the timeout which is 1000, relative to the <code>currentTime</code>,
 * that is from the time that it is scheduled.
 * <p>
 * This ensures regardless of the timeout peroid an object will always
 * be released at some time because its priority is based on the time
 * it entered the <code>SchedulerQueue</code>.
