/**
 * This is used to match <code>String</code>'s with the first pattern
 * that <code>String</code> matches. A pattern consists of characters
 * with either the '*' or '?' characters as wild characters. The '*'
 * character is completely wild meaning that is will match nothing or
 * a long sequence of characters. The '?' character matches a single
 * character.
 * <p>
 * If the '?' character immediately follows the '*' character then the
 * match is made as any sequence of characters up to the first match 
 * of the next character. For example "/*?/index.jsp" will match all 
 * files preceeded by only a single path. So "/pub/index.jsp" will
 * match, however "/pub/bin/index.jsp" will not, as it has two paths.
 * So, in effect the '*?' sequence will match anything or nothing up
 * to the first occurence of the next character in the pattern.
 * <p>
 * A design goal of the <code>Resolver</code> was to make it capable
 * of  high performance in a multithreaded environment. In order to
 * achieve a high performance the <code>Resolver</code> can cache the
 * resolutions it makes so that if the same text is given to the
 * <code>Resolver.resolve</code> method a cached result can be retrived
 * quickly which will decrease the length of time a thread occupies the
 * synchronized method. The cache used is a <code>CacheList</code>.
 * <p>
 * The semantics of the resolver are such that the last pattern inserted
 * with a wild string is the first one checked for a match. This means
 * that if a sequence of insertions like <code>insert(a,b)</code>
 * <code>insert(x,y)</code> is made and then a <code>resolve(z)</code>
 * is attemped then z will be compared to x first and then a, if z 
 * matches x then y is given as the result and if z matches a then b 
 * will be returned, remember if z matches both a and x then y will be
 * the result due to the fact that is was the last pattern inserted.
