 * The <code>ProcessPermission</code> is used to provide access

 * to use the <code>getInstance</code> method, which in effect
 * will provide access to all the methods of the process queue.
 * The permission that is required is the "execute" permission.
 * <p>
 * This is required because the <code>ProcessQueue</code> is a
 * singleton instance, so if any foreign code is loaded it must
 * have permissions before using <code>execute</code> on the
 * <code>ProcessQueue</code>, which can cause deadlock.
