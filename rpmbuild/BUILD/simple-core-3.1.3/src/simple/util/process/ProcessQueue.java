/**
 * The <code>ProcessQueue</code> object provides a means for quick
 * independent executions. This is a thread cache, the aim  of this
 * is to make execution of <code>Runnable</code> objects quick. The
 * <code>Runnable</code> objects given to this should be transient
 * so that the thread can be reused. This should not be used as an
 * easy way to access a thread.
 * <p>
 * When an object needs to be run in its own thread then usually 
 * a separate thread object needs to be created and initialized 
 * for that object to execute. However this is an expensive 
 * undertaking for the system. A cheaper way to execute the objects 
 * is to create a number of the threads and allow these threads to
 * process <code>Runnable</code> objects when they are free, i.e. 
 * not busy with another <code>Runnable</code>. This removes the 
 * need for the expensive initialization of the threads for every 
 * execution of an object. 
 * <p>
 * The <code>ProcessQueue</code> extends the <code>Observable</code>
 * object. This enables any object that may be using this to 
 * receive notification when the <code>ProcessQueue.resize</code>
 * is used. The need for notifications is evident when there is
 * a small number of threads. If <code>Runnable</code> objects are
 * executed, and remain in execution for a long time, the number of
 * threads active can be equal to the number of threads pooled. This
 * means that any object executing the <code>execute</code> method 
 * will be frozen waiting for a <code>Runnable</code> to finish.
