/**
 * The <code>Buffer</code> is intended to be a general purpose byte 
 * <code>Buffer</code>. The intended use of the <code>Buffer</code> 
 * is to allow the constructiuon of buffering for streams to be 
 * seamless and easy.
 * <p>
 * This provides several convinence methods which make the use of the 
 * <code>Buffer</code> easy and useful. The <code>Buffer</code> object 
 * allows an initial capacity to be specified however if there is a 
 * need for extra space to be added to the <code>Buffer</code> then the 
 * append methods will expand the capacity of the <code>Buffer</code> 
 * as needed. 
 * <p>
 * This is also capable of appending other <code>Buffer</code> objects,
 * which is quicker that extracting the bytes and then appending those 
 * bytes to the second <code>Buffer</code>. The append methods have 
 * much the same semantics as the <code>java.lang.StringBuffer</code>.
