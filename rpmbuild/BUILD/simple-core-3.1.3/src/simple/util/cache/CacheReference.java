/**
 * This is used so that <code>TimeCache</code> can have items removed
 * when all references to it are gone. The <code>CacheReference</code> 
 * is a special type of reference. Once an object is enqueued into the 
 * <code>TimeCache</code> then that object is wrapped in a 
 * <code>CacheReference</code> and scheduled for removal. 
 * <p>
 * Once the objects time in the queue has finished then the reference
 * is obtained. The <code>CacheReference</code> is then searched to see 
 * if it still holds the cached item. If it does not hold the cached 
 * item then that item must have lost all its references because the 
 * semantics of the <code>java.lang.ref.SoftReference</code> says that 
 * it will release an object for garbage collection only when all 
 * references to it are gone. This means that it has already been 
 * removed from the cache. If however the <code>CacheReference</code> 
 * still contains the cached item then the reference can behave as a 
 * key into the <code>TimeCache</code> for the item. The reference 
 * can then be used to access the cached item for removal, or whatever.
