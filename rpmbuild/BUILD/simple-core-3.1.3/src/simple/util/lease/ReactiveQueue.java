 * This class implements a <code>ReactiveQueue</code>. This class 
 * is implemented in such a way that objects are added using an  
 * <code>add</code> function. The <code>add</code> function takes 
 * two paramaters an object and a long. 
 * <p>
 * The object represents an item in the queue, the long indicates 
 * its priority in the queue. The remove function in this class 
 * returns the object first in the queue and that object is removed 
 * from the queue permenantly. This differs from a conventional
 * priority queue in that it allows the priority of elements to
 * be changed by adding an existing element with a new priority.
