 * collection of cookies iterates through the set of cookies 
 * using the <code>hasMore</code> and <code>next</code> methods.
 * The <code>reset</code> method is used to start from the first
 * cookie. This allows the collection to be used again.
 * <p>
 * The <code>CookieCollection</code> is <code>Serializable</code>
 * so it can be stored. This allows the user to keep the cookies
 * from the list for permenant storage. This does not extend the
 * <tt>Collection</tt> interface because it is a simple iterator
 * that is used with the <tt>CookieParser</tt> object.
