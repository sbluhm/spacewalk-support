/**
 * The <code>Path</code> represents the path part of a URI. This provides 
 * the various components of the URI path to the user. The normalization
 * of the path is the conversion of the path given into it's actual path by
 * removing the references to the parent directorys and to the current dir.
 * <p>
 * If the path that this represents is <code>/usr/bin/../etc/./README</code>
 * then the actual path, normalized, is <code>/usr/etc/README</code>. This
 * will also provide a localization from the path. The localization is there 
 * if a second extension exists within the path, for example if the path was
 * <code>/usr/bin/file.ext.ext</code>. The second extension will be parsed so
 * that all the characters before the first underscore character, '_', will
 * define the language and all the characters after the first underscore will
 * define the country, for example <code>index.en_US.html</code> will have
 * the language en and the country would be US. This should only support two 
 * character codes for both language and country.
